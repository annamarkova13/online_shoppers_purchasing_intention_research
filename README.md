### **Research objectives**
1. Explore user engagement patterns across pages (administrative, informational, and product-related).
2. Investigate the impact of categorical features like Region, TrafficType, Operating System, and Browser on revenue.
3. Detect outliers and analyze their effects on user behavior and model performance.
4. Build a predictive model for identifying sessions likely to generate revenue.

### **Research Tasks**
1. **Data cleaning and validation**: find duplicates and outliers, validate data types
2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**:
   - Univariate analysis of numerical and categorical features.
   - Bivariate analysis by target variable (Revenue).
   - Correlation analysis to identify relationships among features.
3. **Cluster analysis**: Segmented user sessions into behavioral groups.
4. **Predictive modeling**: Compared Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression to predict revenue.

|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Improved user targeting**       | Understanding key user behaviors (e.g., product page engagement, bounce rates) allows for better segmentation and targeting of campaigns. |
| **Revenue maximization**          | Focused improvements on high-impact pages (e.g., product-related pages) can directly increase conversions. <br>  Strategies tailored to high-value users and time-intensive explorers enhance revenue opportunities.|
| **Strategic campaign planning**   | Insights on peak activity months and special days enable data-driven marketing campaigns, aligning with user behavior patterns. |
| **Enhanced retention strategies** | Targeted approaches for returning visitors, who form the majority of sessions, can improve loyalty and repeat purchases. |
| **Operational efficiency**        | Cluster-based strategies optimize resources by prioritizing high-value segments and addressing the pain points of low-engagement users. |
| **Data-driven decisions**         | Predictive modeling enables the identification of revenue-generating sessions, guiding business strategies with precision.|

#### **Key insights**

1. **User engagement**:
   - Product-related pages dominate user engagement, indicating their critical role in driving purchases.
   - Administrative and informational pages see minimal engagement, suggesting they are less relevant to purchase decisions.
  
  
2. **Behavioral patterns**:
   - Returning visitors have higher session counts but lower conversion rates (14%) compared to new visitors (25%).
   - Peak activity aligns with specific months (March, May, November, December), likely due to seasonality and promotions.
   - Lower bounce and exit rates correlate with higher revenue sessions.
  
  
3. **Cluster analysis**:
   - Identified four clusters:
     - **Low Engagement Users**: Minimal interaction, requiring targeted recommendations.
     - **High Value-Oriented Users**: Engaged and revenue-contributing users who value personalized offers.
     - **Time-Intensive Explorers**: High engagement but low conversion; need better navigation tools.
     - **Focused Interactors**: Efficient engagement; can be encouraged to explore more.
  
  
4. **Correlation analysis**:
   - Strong correlations between page counts and durations (e.g., ProductRelated vs. ProductRelated_Duration).
   - Moderate positive correlation between Revenue and PageValues (0.6), indicating high-value pagesâ€™ importance in conversions.
   - Negative correlation between product engagement ratio and bounce/exit rates.
  
  
5. **Predictive modeling**:
   - **XGBoost** performed best with Average Precision=0.963. It effectively captures nearly all positive cases (with Recall = 0.966), ensuring that we do not miss potential buyers and can target them appropriately.
   - **Random Forest** provided balanced performance with high Recall (0.955) and Precision (0.895). Analysing feature importance the model might be overfitting, because the PageValues is the most dominant feature that affect on 0.3. 
   - **Logistic Regression** showed lower performance, highlighting the need for more complex models.
  




## Challenges and Solutions

| **Issues**                 | **Challenge**                                      | **Solution**                                      |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Data quality issues**    | Presence of duplicates and potential outliers in the dataset could have skewed the analysis. | Removed 125 duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy. Conducted outlier detection using the IQR method but decided to retain outliers due to their meaningful representation of real-world behavior (e.g., long product-related browsing sessions). For predictive modeling, outliers were capped at the 95th percentile to reduce the impact of extremes. |
| **Skewed feature distributions** | Highly skewed distributions in features like time spent on pages, bounce rates, and page values, making standard statistical approaches less reliable. | Used robust methods like medians and percentiles for summarizing skewed data. Applied transformations (e.g., log or capped outliers) to stabilize the analysis and modeling process. |
| **Understanding user behavior** | Identifying how different features (numerical and categorical) impact purchasing decisions and which to prioritize. | Performed detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns (e.g., high engagement on product-related pages). Used correlation and bivariate analysis to pinpoint strong predictors of revenue (e.g., PageValues, Product_Related features). |
| **Categorical deature dependencies** | Determining which categorical features (e.g., Visitor Type, Traffic Type, Region) were statistically relevant for predicting revenue. | Conducted Chi-Square tests to establish dependencies between categorical features and the target variable (Revenue). Focused on significant features while excluding irrelevant ones (e.g., Region showed no dependency). |
| **Session-level segmentation** | The dataset included diverse user sessions with varying behaviors, requiring segmentation for actionable insights. | Conducted cluster analysis to segment users into meaningful groups (e.g., High Value-Oriented Users, Time-Intensive Explorers). Designed specific strategies for each cluster to optimize engagement and conversion rates. |
| **Balancing model Precision and Recall** | Ensuring the predictive model captures all potential buyers (high recall) while minimizing false positives (precision). | Compared multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression). Selected XGBoost as the final model for its high recall (0.9655), ensuring that nearly all potential buyers are identified. |
| **Handling strong feature correlations** | Highly correlated features (e.g., ProductRelated and Product_Related_Duration) risked redundancy and overfitting in models. | Identified strong correlations and removed redundant features in predictive modeling to simplify the model and improve interpretability. |
| **Behavioral insights and revenue Ggneration** | Linking user behavior (e.g., time on pages, engagement ratios) to revenue generation for actionable insights. | Created new metrics like product engagement ratio and time-per-page to better capture behavioral nuances. Highlighted key differences between revenue-generating sessions and others (e.g., reduced bounce rates, higher engagement). |
| **Seasonal trends and campaign alignment** | Identifying seasonal trends to align marketing campaigns effectively. | Discovered peaks in sessions and revenue during March, May, November, and December, aligning with shopping holidays and promotions. Recommended focusing campaigns during high-traffic months while exploring strategies for off-peak periods. |
| **Feature engineering for predictive modeling** | Enhancing predictive power while managing model complexity. | Engineered new features such as product engagement ratio, administrative time per page, and product time per page. Encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding for model compatibility. |
