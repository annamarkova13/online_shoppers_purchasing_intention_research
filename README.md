### **Key insights**

1. **User engagement**:
   - Product-related pages dominate user engagement, indicating their critical role in driving purchases.
   - Administrative and informational pages see minimal engagement, suggesting they are less relevant to purchase decisions.
  
  
2. **Behavioral patterns**:
   - Returning visitors have higher session counts but lower conversion rates (14%) compared to new visitors (25%).
   - Peak activity aligns with specific months (March, May, November, December), likely due to seasonality and promotions.
   - Lower bounce and exit rates correlate with higher revenue sessions.
  
  
3. **Cluster analysis**:
   - Identified four clusters:
     - **Low Engagement Users** Cluster 1 (6%): This cluster represents users with minimal engagement and poor interaction with the appâ€™s features. They likely need more targeted recommendations or smoother onboarding to improve their experience.
     - **High Value-Oriented Users** Cluster 3 (7%): Engaged and revenue-contributing users who value personalized offers. Users in this cluster are highly engaged and value the content provided. Strategies to further enhance their experience could include personalized offers or advanced search/filtering features.
     - **Time-Intensive Explorers** Cluster 2 (14%): High engagement but low conversion; need better navigation tools. This cluster consists of users who spend a significant amount of time exploring products but may not always focus on high-value pages. Consider optimizing product categorization or providing better navigation to help them find relevant content faster.
     - **Focused Interactors** Cluster 0 (76%): Efficient engagement; can be encouraged to explore more. These users are focused and interact efficiently with products. Despite their lower engagement duration, they maintain high interaction quality. Encouraging further exploration by suggesting complementary products or related categories could increase their engagement.

5. **Predictive modeling**:
   - **XGBoost** performed best with Average Precision=0.963. It effectively captures nearly all positive cases (with Recall = 0.966), ensuring that we do not miss potential buyers and can target them appropriately.
   - **Random Forest** provided balanced performance with high Recall (0.955) and Precision (0.895). Analysing feature importance the model might be overfitting, because the PageValues is the most dominant feature that affect on 0.3. 
   - **Logistic Regression** showed lower performance, highlighting the need for more complex models.
  
For our target metrics, we prioritized:
- Maximizing Accuracy and AUC to evaluate the overall ability of the model to make correct predictions.
- Maximizing Recall to identify as many true sessions with revenue as possible.
  
Based on models with optimized parameters and thresholds, the following results were obtained:
	
| Metrics | Logistic Regression	| Random Forest	| XGBoost |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------|
|Accuracy|	0.880|	0.921	|0.895|
|Precision	|0.883	|0.895	|0.846|
|Recall	|0.875	|0.955	|0.966|
|F1-score	|0.879	|0.924	|0.902|
|Avg. Precision	|0.944	|0.974	|0.963|

Given that **minimizing False Negatives (maximizing Recall** is essential for our use case, **XGBoost is the best choice**. It effectively captures nearly all positive cases (Recall = 0.966 and Average Precision=0.963), ensuring that we do not miss potential buyers and can target them appropriately.  
The analysis highlights the significant impact of specific categorical features such as Region, TrafficType, Operating System, and Browser. These features contribute heavily to the model's ability to make accurate predictions.  
To further improve performance and tailor predictions, it may be beneficial to build region-specific prediction models. This approach could provide deeper insights into the unique characteristics and behaviors within each region, ultimately enhancing our understanding and improving targeting accuracy.  



## Challenges and Solutions

| **Issues**                 | **Challenge**                                      | **Solution**                                      |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Data quality issues**    | Presence of duplicates and potential outliers in the dataset could have skewed the analysis. | Removed 125 duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy. Conducted outlier detection using the IQR method but decided to retain outliers due to their meaningful representation of real-world behavior (e.g., long product-related browsing sessions). For predictive modeling, outliers were capped at the 95th percentile to reduce the impact of extremes. |
| **Skewed feature distributions** | Highly skewed distributions in features like time spent on pages, bounce rates, and page values, making standard statistical approaches less reliable. | Used robust methods like medians and percentiles for summarizing skewed data. Applied transformations (e.g., log or capped outliers) to stabilize the analysis and modeling process. |
| **Understanding user behavior** | Identifying how different features (numerical and categorical) impact purchasing decisions and which to prioritize. | Performed detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns (e.g., high engagement on product-related pages). Used correlation and bivariate analysis to pinpoint strong predictors of revenue (e.g., PageValues, Product_Related features). |
| **Categorical feature dependencies** | Determining which categorical features (e.g., Visitor Type, Traffic Type, Region) were statistically relevant for predicting revenue. | Conducted Chi-Square tests to establish dependencies between categorical features and the target variable (Revenue). Focused on significant features while excluding irrelevant ones (e.g., Region showed no dependency). |
| **Session-level segmentation** | The dataset included diverse user sessions with varying behaviors, requiring segmentation for actionable insights. | Conducted cluster analysis to segment users into meaningful groups (e.g., High Value-Oriented Users, Time-Intensive Explorers). Designed specific strategies for each cluster to optimize engagement and conversion rates. |
| **Balancing model Precision and Recall** | Ensuring the predictive model captures all potential buyers (high recall) while minimizing false positives (precision). | Compared multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression). Selected XGBoost as the final model for its high recall (0.9655), ensuring that nearly all potential buyers are identified. |
| **Handling strong feature correlations** | Highly correlated features (e.g., ProductRelated and Product_Related_Duration) risked redundancy and overfitting in models. | Identified strong correlations and removed redundant features in predictive modeling to simplify the model and improve interpretability. |
| **Behavioral insights and revenue Ggneration** | Linking user behavior (e.g., time on pages, engagement ratios) to revenue generation for actionable insights. | Created new metrics like product engagement ratio and time-per-page to better capture behavioral nuances. Highlighted key differences between revenue-generating sessions and others (e.g., reduced bounce rates, higher engagement). |
| **Seasonal trends and campaign alignment** | Identifying seasonal trends to align marketing campaigns effectively. | Discovered peaks in sessions and revenue during March, May, November, and December, aligning with shopping holidays and promotions. Recommended focusing campaigns during high-traffic months while exploring strategies for off-peak periods. Used new metric to evaluate peak months for predidtion models.|
| **Feature engineering for predictive modeling** | Enhancing predictive power while managing model complexity. | Engineered new features such as product engagement ratio, administrative time per page, and product time per page. Encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding for model compatibility. Adjusted the weights assigned to each class during model training (with SMOTE), that gave higher weight to the minority class and lower weight to the majority class.|
